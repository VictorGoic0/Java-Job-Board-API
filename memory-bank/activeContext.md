# Active Context: Job Board API

## Current Focus

Initiating project; Memory Bank established. No application code exists yet—only PRD and phase task files.

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank created: projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext, activeContext, progress.
- Tech stack and version numbers documented; project overview captured (job board platform API, Spring Boot, Java).

## Next Steps

- Phase I: Initialize Spring Boot (Maven), add dependencies, Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, configure `application.yml`, implement entities (Company, Job), enums, repositories, services, controllers, DTOs, validation, global exception handler, optimistic locking.
- Proceed phase by phase; do not skip ahead (per PRD).

## Active Decisions

- Follow PRD and phase task files as source of truth.
- Version numbers and stack fixed in techContext (Java 17+, Spring Boot 3.x, PostgreSQL 15, etc.).
- No record of personal or motivational context in Memory Bank—only project and technical facts.
