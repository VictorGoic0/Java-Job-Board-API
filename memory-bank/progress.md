# Progress: Job Board API

## What Works

- Documentation only: PRD.md and phase task files (phase_1 through phase_4_part_2). Memory Bank initialized.
- No runnable application or tests yet.

## What's Left to Build

- **Phase I**: Project setup, Docker Compose (PostgreSQL), entities, repositories, services, controllers, DTOs, validation, exception handling, optimistic locking—full CRUD for Companies and Jobs.
- **Phase II**: Search/filter, pagination, active jobs endpoint, deactivate (soft delete).
- **Phase III**: Unit tests (services), repository tests (H2), controller tests (MockMvc).
- **Phase IV**: Security (JWT, roles), User entity, file upload (resumes), Application entity and endpoints, scheduled job expiration.

## Current Status

Pre–Phase I. Ready to create Spring Boot project and implement Phase I per PRD and phase_1_tasks.md.

## Known Issues

None. No codebase yet.
